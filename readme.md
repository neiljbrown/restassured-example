#REST-assured Example

##Overview
This project provides an example of how to use the [REST-assured](http://rest-assured.io/) library to write black-box, 
functional tests for REST APIs in Java.

REST-assured is a Java library that aims to make it simpler to write out-of-process, functional tests for REST APIs, 
that are written in Java (or other JVM languages). It runs on top of existing Java testing frameworks (JUnit or 
NUnit), and includes a DSL for building API requests and asserting API responses.
   
In this example project, REST-assured is used to implement a suite of functional tests for a couple of REST APIs 
hosted by an imaginary User service that supports creating and retrieving a resource/entity known as a (user) 'realm', 
via HTTP POST and GET methods. An outline spec. of these APIs is included below. 
    
##Code
The example REST-assured test cases are implemented in Java (8.x) using JUnit (4.x), REST-assured (3.x) and AssertJ.

The tests can be found in two Java classes in the project's src/main/test/java folder:
* com.neiljbrown.service.user.CreateRealmApiTest - Test suite for the [Create Realm API](#createRealm)
* com.neiljbrown.service.user.GetRealmApiTest - Test suite for the [Get Realm API](#createRealm)

The APIs under test have been stubbed-out (using the [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) library). This makes the example 
tests simple to run, by avoiding a dependency on a real API service having been deployed, and needing to be 
running in a separate process. For the purposes of this project you can ignore the stubbing and use of WireMock.

##Building and Running the Examples 
The example tests can be compiled and run from within the comfort of your IDE (or from the command line using 
Gradle).

First ensure you have JDK 8+ installed.  

Then cd to the directory into which you cloned/checked-out the project and use the supplied Gradle build script to 
generate an IDE project for either Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, using one of the following commands  
``./gradlew eclipse`` or ``./gradlew idea`` 

Import the generated project into your IDE. 

Open the project in your IDE and run the tests contained in one of the aforementioned test classes as you would a 
JUnit test. 

To compile and run the tests from the command line enter the command ``./gradlew test`` 

##API Specification
This section contains the spec. of the couple of APIs for which the tests have been written.

The APIs specified support creating, retrieving and deleting a (User) Realm.
 
###Realm Resource
A (User) Realm is a context for the registration and authentication of a user.  The resource comprises the following 
fields. All fields are mandatory unless otherwise stated.

|Field Name|Description & Constraints|
|----------|-------------------------|
|id|Unique, system-generated identifier for the realm. An integer value in the range 1 to 9999.
|name|Unique name of the realm. Serves as an alias for the realm ID. Max length of 100 chars.|
|description|Description of the realm. Optional. Max length of 255 chars.| 
|key|System generated encryption key. Fixed length 32 char hex-encoded string.|

###Resource Representation
The APIs only support producing and consuming XML representations of a Realm. The schema for this representation, 
specified by example, is as follows -  

```xml
<realm id="123" name="Acme"> 
  <description>Realm for authenticated users of Acme corp.</description> 
  <key>92f1aea4bb92c3661a9c85ee81503e28</key>					
</realm>				
```

###API Error Handling
The APIs report errors by returning an HTTP response with a status code in the 4xx (client) or 5xx (server) range. An
 “error” resource may also be returned in the response body to distinguish errors reported by the API, and to 
further classify an error. An error resource contains a unique code and a message. The error code is a unique string 
in camel-case intended for interpretation by API clients. An example HTTP response for an error returned by the APIs 
is shown below -

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 
Content-type: application/xml; charset=utf-8 
...
<error>						
  <code>RealmNotFound</code>
  <message>Realm [123] not found.</message>	 
</error>
```

###<a name="createRealm"></a> Create Realm API
Creates a new realm including the generation of an encryption key. 

####Supported Methods
